# Portfolio

> Concept: Build a portfolio through stages to include newest tools and technologies.

**Version 1:** `Only using HTML, CSS and JavaScript`

**Version 2:** `Include a package manager (npm or yarn) and module bundler (webpack)`

**Version 3:** `Include transcompiler (babel) and convert JS to use ES6`

**Version 4:** `Convert CSS to use SASS/SCSS`

**Version 5:** `Convert JS to TS`

**Version 6:** `Convert application to use React`

> End goal: Deploy portfolio written in React while learning the benefits and use cases of these tools.
